# Bambusa Fluent additions

Enables fluent support of [bambusa-installer](https://github.com/silverstripe/bambusa-installer).
Separated out to enable reuse of the Bambusa demo without multilingual support,
which is often not part of requirements, complicates the base setup,
and can have side effects if other installed modules aren't
optimised for it.
